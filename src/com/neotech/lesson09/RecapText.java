--------------------------------
Loops - used to repeat a block of code multiple times

while
do while
for loop
enhanced for loop

while OR do while --> When we do NOT know the number of iterations
Are loops to choose when we do NOT know how many times we need to repeat the block of code.

WHILE VS DO WHILE

while --> first checks the condition, then executes the block

do while --> first executes the block of code, exp: system.out.println("==") checks the condition

--------------------------------

for loop --> when we know the number of iteration ahead of time
Is better when we know in advance how many times we want to repeat the block of code

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    code;
}

for (starting point; ending point; increment/decrement) {
	code;
}
--------------------------------
break keyword can be used inside any of the loops
it breaks the loop (as soon as the code reaches break keyword the rest of the code inside the loop will be skipped and the execution will come to the exit of the loop)

continue keyword can be used inside any of the loops
it skips the current iteration (as soon as it reaches the continue keyword the rest of the code will be skipped and the execution will go back to the beginning of the loop)

break --> breaks the loop//not execute code anymore
continue --> skips the current iteration (moves to the next iteration)
