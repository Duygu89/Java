	 * Class 18 -------------------------------- Variables in Java;
	 * 
	 * datatype variableName = value
	 * 
	 * 3 types of Variables in Java: local - variables declared inside the method,
	 * constructors or block of code local variables cannot be accessed outside of
	 * the block of code
	 * 
	 * instance - variables declared inside a class but outside of any method They
	 * are called instance variables because they belong to the instance/object
	 * 
	 * Every time we create an object of the class (create an instance of the
	 * class), every object will have its own copy of those instance variables
	 * Whenever we change the value of a variable of one instance/object, the other
	 * objects are NOT affected.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * static - variables declared inside a class but outside of any method, USING A
	 * STATIC KEYWORD Using static keyword we define common features for all
	 * instances of that class
	 * 
	 * How to access instance variables? By creating an object and using an
	 * reference variable How to access static variables? Using class name where
	 * they been declared
	 * 
	 * Static keyword can be used with variables and methods
